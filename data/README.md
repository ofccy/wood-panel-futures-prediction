# Data Description

This document provides detailed information about the datasets used in the wood-based panel futures price prediction research.

## Overview

The research utilizes two main datasets:
1. Daily wood-based panel futures price data (`day.csv`)
2. Monthly supply chain feature data (`month.csv`)

These datasets cover the period from January 2014 to June 2024.

## Daily Price Data (`day.csv`)

### Source
- **Origin**: Dalian Commodity Exchange, China
- **Collection Method**: Sina Finance API
- **Contract Type**: Fiberboard continuous contracts
- **Time Period**: January 2014 to June 2024

### Data Format
The data is organized in two columns:
- **Date**: Trading date in YYYY/M/D format (e.g., 2014/1/2)
- **Price**: Wood-based panel futures price in Yuan (RMB)

Sample data:
```

```

### Data Processing Notes
- **Unit Standardization**: The Dalian Commodity Exchange adjusted the quotation unit for fiberboard futures from "Yuan (RMB)/piece" to "Yuan (RMB)/mÂ³" on December 3, 2019. Historical prices before this date have been converted assuming equal proportions for three thickness specifications (12mm, 15mm, and 18mm).


## Monthly Supply Chain Data (`month.csv`)
